    description: 'In this dual-part PHP project, the first task involves creating a script that analyzes user-input banknote serial numbers. The script categorizes serial numbers into distinct patterns such as radar notes (palindromes), ladder notes (increasing, decreasing, or a combination), rotator notes (readable upside down), and binary notes (consisting of 0s or 1s). The results, containing matched patterns or declaring the note as "uninteresting serial number," are output as list items. The second task focuses on generating rows and columns for an HTML table with a pyramid-like pattern in the first column and the sum of corresponding numbers in the second. The script, responsive to AJAX requests, creates a function for row generation based on the row number provided, adhering to the specified requirements.',

This application accepts CSV files through a user-friendly interface, allowing users to upload a file and specify a sorting column. The server-side PHP script processes the uploaded CSV data, sorts it based on the selected column, and returns the result as a JSON-encoded array. This project showcases my ability to handle file uploads, process CSV data, and implement sorting functionalities, emphasizing usability and efficiency in data management. Both projects underscore my commitment to producing original, well-documented, and functional solutions, contributing to my growing expertise in PHP development.',
